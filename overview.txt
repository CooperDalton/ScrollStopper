I’m solor-building a SaaS product.

This is a SaaS platform that helps indie hackers, SaaS founders, and dropshippers quickly generate and publish **scroll-stopping TikTok and Instagram slideshow videos** using AI. The tool automates every step of short-form video creation, including scripting, design, and post scheduling — even using uploaded images to understand product context and create better marketing content. Users can generate entire videos from just a few screenshots, product photos, or a product description.

## 🎯 Target Users

- Indie hackers promoting their apps or tools
- SaaS founders looking to post product content consistently
- Dropshippers and ecommerce sellers testing products via TikTok ads
- Solo creators or marketers who want to automate short-form content creation

## 🧰 Core Features (Summarized for AI Tools)

### 🔧 Product Context System

- A “Settings” style page where users describe their product in as much detail as they want (tagline, features, target audience, etc.)
- This context is passed into all AI pipelines to guide image description, hook generation, and slideshow scriptwriting

### 🖼️ Image Upload + Collections

- Users can manually upload images into named collections (e.g., "App Screenshots", "Lifestyle Photos")
- Supports future integrations with Pinterest, Google Images, or an AI image generator
- AI can generate descriptive text and summaries for each image using GPT-4o (Pro feature)
- Preset AI-generated collections for quick start (stock-style generated assets)

### 🧠 AI Image Processing (Pro Feature)

- Each uploaded image is processed by GPT-4o to generate:
    - A ~10 sentence marketing-relevant description
    - A 1 sentence summary
    - JSON format output usable for AI scripting

### 🪄 Auto Slideshow Generator

- For Pro users: one-click slideshow generation using uploaded images + product context
- AI selects image order, writes overlay text per slide, picks durations and music
- Tiered logic:
    - Free users: text is placed randomly using generic logic
    - Pro users: text and format are chosen based on image content + viral patterns
- Initially supports 1 video generation at a time

Main Differentiator

- Like Deepthink for slideshow creation
- See the AI planning your video ideas
- Watch it create multiple videos simultaneously

### 🎨 Manual Editor

- Add or remove slides
- Add background images (auto-handling aspect ratios that are not 1080x1920)
- Add text with editable:
    - Position (x, y)
    - Size
    - Font (1 default font to start)
    - Rotation
- Add additional images to each slide with controls:
    - Crop, size, position, rotation
- Set slide duration
- Add background music
- Save slideshow data and render export-ready videos

### ⚡ Mass Generation (Pro Feature)

- Batch-generate multiple slideshow variants using a well-prompted, trained AI model
- Leverages image descriptions and product context to generate multiple short-form ads
- “Blow Up” feature: if a user likes one format, generate 10 more like it
- All generated slideshows are editable in the manual Editor

### 💡 Hook Ideas Generator + Inspiration Wall

- Train AI on viral TikTok hook styles (especially first-slide content)
- Generate suggested hooks and formats based on product context
- Optionally show a wall of inspirational slides/videos tagged by format (like Reelfarm)

### 📅 Schedule + Post (Coming Soon)

- Modal to select day, time, and target account (TikTok or Instagram)
- Support for bulk scheduling (e.g. 2 videos/day for the next week)
- Manual download is supported in MVP while TikTok API approval is pending

### 📊 Views Dashboard

- Total views generated by content
- Views by month, views per linked account
- Highlight top-performing videos (by views or engagement if tracked)

---

## 🧪 AI Backend Strategy

- Use GPT-4o for image understanding + descriptions
- Use GPT-4o or fine-tuned GPT-3.5 for scripting and hook generation
- Train a private dataset of TikTok slideshow formats (first-slide hooks, duration patterns, visual styles) and use that as hidden input to AI prompts
