# 🚀 MVP Overview: ScrollStopper

This file defines the scope and structure of the **MVP version of ScrollStopper**, an AI-powered tool for generating TikTok/Instagram slideshow videos from product screenshots and descriptions. The goal is to build a usable, differentiated product with a clear workflow and minimum complexity, launching July 22.

---

## ✅ Core MVP Features

### 1. **Landing Page**
- Simple, modern layout
- Clear value proposition
- CTA: “Start Free” or “Try the Demo”
- Should reflect the "AI thinking tool" aesthetic (dark mode, violet accent)
- Link to pricing and login/register

---

### 2. **Stripe Payment Integration**
- Starter plan (default for all signups): no AI features
- Pro plan ($40/month): unlocks AI slideshow generation + image description
- Include:
  - Stripe checkout flow
  - Plan selection during onboarding or inside account settings
  - Store `plan` and `stripe_customer_id` on user record

---

### 3. **Product Description Input**
- Simple form field where users can describe their product (e.g., “A minimal time tracker for builders”)
- This is used by the AI when generating slideshows
- Allow updates/editing from a “Product Info” section

---

### 4. **Editor**
- User can create or edit a slideshow manually
- Slide features:
  - Set background image (handle resizing/padding if not 1080x1920)
  - Add text overlay (1 font, adjustable size)
  - Set slide duration (in seconds)
  - Add music (optional: choose from presets or upload)
- UI should resemble a slide editor/timeline but be minimal and responsive

---

### 5. **Image Uploader / Collections**
- Users can:
  - Create image collections
  - Upload images manually into collections
- For **Pro users**, images are processed in the background by GPT-4o:
  - Generates ~10-sentence description and 1-sentence summary
  - Stored alongside the image record
- UI: drag & drop upload, collection selector

---

### 6. **Auto Slideshow Generator (Pro only)**
- For Pro users only
- System uses:
  - Product description
  - Image descriptions (if available)
- AI generates a complete slideshow:
  - Slide text
  - Image choices
  - Durations
  - Music (default or random)
- Only supports **one slideshow generation at a time** in MVP
- User can edit generated slideshow afterward in Editor

---

### 7. **Manual Video Download**
- After user finishes a slideshow, provide download link for `.mp4` file
- Use `ffmpeg` or `ffmpeg.wasm` to render server/client-side video
- Schedule/posting APIs (e.g. TikTok) are **not included in MVP**

---

## 🎨 MVP Design Notes
- Default dark mode UI with customizable colors via CSS variables
- Use purple/violet as accent color (`--color-primary`)
- Futuristic but minimal feel: the AI should *look like it’s thinking*
- Use animated transitions or “thought preview” loaders where appropriate
